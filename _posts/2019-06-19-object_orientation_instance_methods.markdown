I get super insecure sometimes when it comes to regergitating tech definitions for Ruby or other languages, because it can seem if you mispeak once with the wrong word your 

But-- in the spirit of developing and growing and as I gain confidence in my programming knowledge, I'm going to give this a shot.. to the best of my ability, as candily as possible.. because I think it's important to express what certains tools mean to you in order to help other coders who are just starting out..

Ruby is amazing-- it is very clear and you can easily keep track of your objects when storing and accessing them. It makes me happy to know that I could build little methods that could later be used  in other methods and at the end of my work, it all fit together like a nice little puzzle.

Remember (especially all you 90s kids) doing the puzzles back in the day during the summer or on vacation with the family?  Or on board game nights on the weekend?

(literally just had to type in "paper puzzle old school" in google to get non-digitalized games)

Instance variables as pieces of the puzzle/objects building your program

Instance variables are like the 50 different little puzzle pieces you move around to fit together and build the picture on the top of the box.  In code, instance variables make a program work through running methods that access each variables/objects.  They are part of the class they are written within (like the many pieces within a puzzle box)... The scope of the instance variable is confined to the object that self refers to..

As you piece your methods together through instance variables, you get a working program!  Just like you get a clean picture after arranging the puzzle pieces.
