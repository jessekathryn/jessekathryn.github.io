Ruby is amazing-- it is a very clear language.  You can easily keep track of your objects and variables when storing or accessing them through using specifically named instances that begin with the @ symbol. It makes me happy to know that I can build little methods that later will be used in other methods and at the end of my work, it all fit together like a nice little puzzle.

Remember (especially all you 90s kids) doing the puzzles back in the day during the summer or on vacation with the family?  Or on board game nights on the weekend?

literally just had to type in "paper puzzle old school" in google to get non-digitalized games

of course let's reference a Disney Princess puzzle

Instance variables as pieces of the puzzle/objects building your program

Instance variables are like the 50 different little puzzle pieces you move around to fit together and build the picture on the top of the box.  In code, instance variables make a program work through running methods that access each variables/objects.  They are part of the class they are written within (like the many pieces within a puzzle box)... The scope of the instance variable is confined to the object that self refers to..

As you piece your methods together through instance variables, you get a working program!  Just like you get a clean picture after arranging the puzzle pieces.
