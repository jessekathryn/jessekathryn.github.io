**2019 Phone Updates - CNET** 
### Conception 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________


One and a half week later, after getting over my biggest fear so far and realizing my first project was approaching, the work begins.  

*It helped to take time on the student scraping lab to feel better prepared. * 

The idea for the CNET Best Phone Gem came from a personal interest: new phone developments.  I We are always on our phones today; subsequently, let's make sure you stay up to speed.  CNET is the source of choice for the gem, as it is the longtime go-to for all of my tech inquiries- irregardless of whether it is time to buy new products.  

The CNET Best Phone Gem will come from a webpage on CNET.com.  The articles, as well as their respective attributes, will come from the lastest updates on CNET's products page, or https://www.cnet.com/topics/phones/best-phones/.

This gem will allow you to chose a phone from a CLI
