Very excited about this project. 

My dad has a farm and a ton of cows.  He usually uses his working memory and notepad on his phone for his data.  When it was time to build my first app, it seemed like a no-brainer to help my dad track his farm and cows.

It turned out to be an extremely rewarding experience.  The whole family pitched in for feedback and it was very cool to see it all come together from conception to utilization.
