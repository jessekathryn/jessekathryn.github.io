Working on this app has taught me a lot about rails development.  I started the app for my dad.  It is for him to use on his farm!  Overtime, I started to take pride in the work (my sinatra app was a beta version of this).  

The last version was very basic with front-end design and for this project, I was happy to try and work on a more advanced interface.

The creation of this ruby app made me extremely excited for the future.  After building the basic functions of the app, I started to build out a dashboard for the user's profile.  This initiated a creation of my "reports" link, mainly as a decoration of the page in the beginning, that developed into an actual model with a controller views and functions!  I realized I could actually generate small reports of my user's information within the app, at the level of code I've learned in the curriculum.  The level of automation with something as simple as cataloging cows is complex, but very entertaining!

The app isn't finished just yet and the idea of created reports or generating a CRM for my dad has made me grateful for this program.   My current landing page is below!

This is my landing page.  I used boostrap with my ruby on rails app and html, as well as, CSS (of course).  In the near future, there will be a blog post on how I did this and a few tips to get around painstaking debugging hours.. especially if you are new to javascript. Implementing the simple front-end of JavaScript into my project provided a ton of confidence and esteem when moving to the JavaScript section (where I currently am).
