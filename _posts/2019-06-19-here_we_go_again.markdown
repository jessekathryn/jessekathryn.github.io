Just starting out again after a nearly 10 year haitus from coding.. It seems like its a passion that will not let me forget how much I love and care for it.. I went to school for my MFA and yet, I still returned to coding.  

I was only able to work in New York after my MFA, because I was good on computers and deemed useful.  I became an assistant to several big businessmen in the city after finally realizing, I want to help more than one person with my skills and <3 for computers/code.  My best friends at work were mostly Tech teams and coders, so it finally became clear.. even though it seemed scary to study something I left behind 10 years ago in college, I thought I'd give it one last try..
