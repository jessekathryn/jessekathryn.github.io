Just starting out again after a nearly 10 year haitus from coding.. It seems like its a passion that will not let me forget how much I love and care for it.. I went to school for my MFA and yet, I still returned to coding.  

I was only able to find work in New York after completing my MFA, as an assistant to executives, because I was good on computers and deemed useful. All experience up until this point revolved around film.  Meanwhile, gaining professional experience in an office environment, I recommited myself to not only just helping one executive as his/her assistant, but grew and evolved to providing support and troubleshooting to more than one person with my skills and <3 for computers/code.  Even though it took sometime, I finally found my way to give back to the world as a professional woman and I was excited. 

It was clear to me when my closest colleagues at work were mostly on the Tech teams and coder..  It seemed very scary to study something I left behind 10 years ago in college, but I thought I'd give it one last try..
